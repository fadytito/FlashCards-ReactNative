# FlashCards-ReactNative

#### Project: FlashCards-ReactNative

### Description. 

Flashcards is an app that helps you study. For each subject or category you are studying, you create a deck. Each deck (category) will contain questions (cards) you want to asnwer. 

The app comprises of "Decks" containing "Cards". Each deck you create will contain questions (cards) for a particular category (deck). For each card you create a question and an answer. 

Once you have a deck with cards, you can start a quiz to test your knowledge. As you go through the quiz, you will mark your answers as "Correct" or "Incorrect". At the end of your quiz you will get a score. 

Happy studying!
